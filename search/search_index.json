You can play a vital role in supporting the energy transition by helping to map electrical grids in your local area. These grids need modernization and expansion to meet the demands of electrification and decarbonization, but a lack of reliable data is a major barrier. Grid data provides governments, utilities, developers, and researchers with the information needed to plan effectively. That's where you come in.</p> <p>In recent years, OpenStreetMap has emerged as the de facto standard for global electrical grid data. However, many developing countries are still lagging behind. This gap limits rural energy access and slows down climate action:</p>        Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.      <p>       Key Recommendation - International Energy Agency: How to implement the COP28 energy goals </p> <p>This is why Open Energy Transition has launched this open initiative in collaboration with Datactivist, Jungle Bus, Dynartio and Infrageomatics. We are working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an open digital twin of the European grid, but also to expand the global coverage of the transmission grid in OpenStreetMap from around 70% to 98% by 2028.  We need your support to create and maintain a global dataset on the power grid that is validated by humans and thus meets the highest quality standards.</p> <p>OpenStreetMap's already extensive data on the electrical grid can be browsed on Open Infrastructure Map, showing the global scale of data collected since 2008, mostly by volunteers.</p> <p>A global community of citizen contributors creates and maintains data on the core infrastructures of our modern society.

We map transmission lines that link cities. The transmission grid infrastructure is so large that it can be traced and mapped using open satellite images. However, the distribution grid cannot be mapped sufficiently well using open satellite images alone and therefore requires strong collaboration with local communities and authorities. For this reason, this is not currently our main focus. If you are interested in contributing to the distribution side, however, you should start by mapping distribution substations, most of which can also be classified using satellite images. If you are local and/or have local knowledge, you are welcome to map any infrastructure you are familiar with.</p>"},{"location":"questions/#wont-all-of-this-be-solved-by-ai-soon","title":"Won't all of this be solved by AI soon?","text":"<p>To ensure data quality, each data point in OpenStreetMap must be set and validated by a human. This prevents OpenStreetMap from becoming flooded with synthetic, unvalidated data that would not be suitable as ground truth in the long term. Furthermore, there are currently no detection methods that can accurately identify power towers and the course of transmission lines using classic RGB satellites alone. Grid mapping is a task that requires a high degree of expertise and contextual understanding. Due to the high relevance of this data, stochastic generation of the grid by AI is also not recommended. To validate this data, specialists must perform active grid mapping. However, we are currently evaluating the use of open-source substation detection based on Sentinel 2 data to provide another hint layer of substations for the mappers. By contrast, in many cases, synthetic data is often the only source that can be used to estimate the grid distribution with reasonable effort. OpenStreetMap's distribution and transmission grid substations are essential for creating ground truth data for AI-based estimation of distribution grid data.</p>"},{"location":"questions/#does-publishing-this-data-create-a-security-risk","title":"Does publishing this data create a security risk?","text":"<p>No, publishing grid data through MapYourGrid does not meaningfully increase security risks. This concern is understandable. After all, electrical grids are critical infrastructure. However, multiple studies and real-world practices show that open grid data does not elevate threat levels, for several key reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Much of the grid is already visible and documented. Transmission lines are easily observable in satellite imagery and by anyone on the ground. Most Substations are already in platforms like Google Maps. Major institutions, including government agencies, have publicly shared detailed grid data for decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sophisticated actors already have better data. State-sponsored or malicious actors do not rely on OpenStreetMap. They have access to more advanced tools, commercial imagery, or even insider or cyber channels. Blocking public access doesn\u2019t prevent their activity, but it hinders legitimate use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open data helps defenders more than attackers. Transparency allows utilities, researchers, and planners to spot weaknesses, model failures, and improve resilience. Public access to routing data supports cross-border planning and faster emergency response.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cSecurity through obscurity\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Hiding infrastructure details often impedes innovation and risk mitigation. As noted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), obscurity is not a reliable security strategy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>MapYourGrid builds on a decade of public infrastructure mapping, including global comparisons showing alignment with government datasets. Our mission is to democratize access for resilience, transparency, and innovation, not to expose anything adversaries don\u2019t already know.

The following strategies and tools will help you to extend existing transmission grid networks on OpenStreetMap. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb: The larger the towers and substations, the higher the voltage and the greater their relevance to the transmission grid. Priority should therefore be given to large, high-voltage infrastructure first. </p> <p>Please consider the following strategies and the associated processes as recommendations only. Ultimately, the most efficient strategy is the one that enables you to work on the electrical grid with passion and motivation over a longer period of time. The strategies can be divided into two phases, with a quality assurance and validation process running alongside them.</p> <p>Pioneer Mapping Strategies: To ensure the power grid has the best possible coverage, we recommend beginning with Pioneer Mapping in each country. Several strategies are employed at this stage to identify the location of all lines, power poles, and substations. Rather than reducing issues in the grid, the main focus is on increasing extending geographic coverage of the grid. This may result in an increased total number of issues in the grid. These strategies focus primarily on mapping the geographical location of power lines, towers, plants and substations, rather than technical grid details. They require good eyesight, fast mapping skills and an understanding of situations in which satellite data is insufficient for consistent grid mapping.</p> <p>Technical Mapping Strategies: This phase involves solving complex grid issues that require a fundamental understanding of the electrical grid. This includes mapping voltages, the number of circuits and routing issues. During this phase, the initial mapping work is validated against multiple sources to ensure its plausibility. These sources could include official maps from grid operators, statistics about grid length, and other official data. The main focus of these strategies is to minimise the number of complex quality issues in the grid.</p> <p>Quality Assurance and Validation: Quality assurance runs parallel to both mapping phases and ensures that all data is verifiable, follows agreed tagging standards, is traceable, and can be reviewed by others.

This tool checks for common mapping errors such as: Illogical tag combinations, Unusual geometries (e.g., excessively long spans between power towers) or incomplete or deprecated data.</p> <p>Warnings are prominently flagged, and mappers are discouraged from uploading until they are resolved, promoting a high standard of data hygiene.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual Quality Checks with Custom Map Styles</p> <p>Custom map painting styles specific to power infrastructure make it easier to spot errors visually within JOSM.
