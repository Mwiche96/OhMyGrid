1. The [Global Electrification Platform](https://electrifynow.energydata.info/) and [Distributed Renewable Energy Atlas](https://dre.energydata.info/), developed and used by the World Bank, are used for planning electrification and expansion of renewable energy in rural areas across 58 countries. Using OpenStreetMap's transmission lines, roads, buildings, and settlements, it helps identify off-grid populations and informs planning for both grid and off-grid electrification strategies. gep-onsset, the Open Source Software behind Global Electrification Platform, [relies heavily on electrical grid data of OpenStreetMap](https://gep-onsset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GIS%20data%20collection.html#infrastructure).

1. The [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) provides high-quality, open geospatial data to inform decision-makers during early disaster response. More than 419,000 volunteer mappers have contributed to this initiative. The platform allows collaboration between multiple organizations, like satellite imaging providers like Maxar and humanitarian agencies such as the Red Cross. This collaborative platform ensures that critical, life-saving decisions are grounded in traceable and verifiable data. Especially as the frequency of extreme weather events increases, accurate electrical grid data [plays a key role in disaster response at the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://github.com/USAFORUNHCRhive/turkana-grid-mapping).

1. The World Bank's [EnergyData.info](https://energydata.info/dataset/?q=OpenStreetMap) website hosts over 1,072 energy-related datasets, 533 of which directly depend on OpenStreetMap data. The World Bank uses this data to finance and support energy infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries, including expanding energy access, modernizing power systems, and promoting clean energy solutions. This data is been used to create report for Decision Makers such as [Mini Grids for Half a Billion People](https://www.esmap.org/sites/default/files/esmap-files/Mini%20Grids%20for%20Half%20a%20Billion%20People%20-%20OKR%20Download%20Version_compressed_MKA.pdf).


## **<div class="tools-header">How and why is it used for the Electrical Grid?</div>**


OpenStreetMap’s electrical grid data is actively used by grid operators, academic institutions, government agencies, local authorities, and private organizations. This data plays a crucial role in energy modeling and planning, informing both policy development and investment decisions. 

These simulations help to evaluate technological options, the impact of policies, and the pathways to achieving full electrification, especially in developing countries. Energy models are essential for advancing decarbonization goals and achieving sustainable development. However, the effectiveness of these models depends heavily on the **quality and completeness of the data** they rely on.

Image Source: <a href="https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Modelling the high-voltage grid using open data for
Europe and beyond</a></figcaption> 
</div> 


[PyPSA-Earth](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is the first energy model to enable regional studies based on OpenStreetMap to be carried out across the globe. The data is clustered into larger regional electrical hubs to simplify the power system model and improve computational efficiency. However, the energy potential of entire regions is underestimated if lines and substations are missing. Therefore, improving the current state of the OpenStreetMap's electrical grid data significantly enhances the reliability and effectiveness of this planning tool for energy studies in [regions all around the world](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users_list.html#). Initial attempts to use OpenStreetMap data for energy modeling are being made by the German Aerospace Center with the [SciGrid](https://www.dlr.de/en/ve/research-and-transfer/projects/project-scigrid) project starting in 2014. Afterwards project like [OSMoGrid](https://github.com/ie3-institute/OSMoGrid), [GridTool](https://github.com/IEE-TUGraz/GridTool), [osmTGmod](https://github.com/wupperinst/osmTGmod) and [OpenGridMap](https://github.com/opengridmap) have continued this development first focusing on the German electrical grid.

###  Valued by International Organizations

Organizations such as the **World Bank** and the **International Energy Agency (IEA)** rely on OpenStreetMap data for regional and continental energy analyses. In many cases, OpenStreetMap provides the **only available** source of open, accessible infrastructure data. Making such data publicly available adds considerable **societal value** for planning and clean energy transitions, while also creating **economic value** for the private sector:

Reliable and open infrastructure data directly supports the **adoption and success of clean energy projects** globally. These projects are being accelerated for several critical reasons:

* **Climate mitigation:** Fossil fuels account for roughly 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Resilience:** Clean energy strengthens resilience against climate impacts and extreme weather events.
* **Energy security:** Reducing reliance on imports enhances national energy independence, especially from politically unstable or hostile regions.

### Growing Academic Impact

To assess the influence of OpenStreetMap electrical grid data in research, we analysed Google Scholar for publications combining `OpenStreetMap` with terms like `power grid`, `electrical grid`, `renewable` or `energy model`.

* 10,700 publications since 2005 included combinations of these keywords.
* A total of **2,460 publications** were released in the last year alone, demonstrating a rapid increase in academic engagement with, and recognition of, the power of OpenStreetMap data.


## **<div class="tools-header">Why is it important that this data is open?</div>**

Access to open and accurate data on electricity infrastructure is essential for effective planning, development, and collaboration, especially in the context of the global energy transition. The benefits are far-reaching, particularly for developing countries and emerging economies.

### Bridging Data Gaps in Developing Countries

</div> 

In many low- and middle-income countries, data on electrical infrastructure is **outdated, incomplete, or fragmented**. This presents a significant barrier for governments, utilities, and planners. Even in high-income countries, while data may be more comprehensive, it is often **not publicly available** or limited by restrictive licensing. This hinders transparency and the ability to collaborate or validate results.


Open data ensures that:

* Infrastructure planning is **more inclusive and cost-effective**.
* Datasets can be **cross-checked, reused, and improved** collaboratively.
* Policymakers and planners have **a reliable foundation** for decision-making.

### Transparency, Traceability and Public Trust

OpenStreetMap's unique mapping methodology, which cannot be replicated by proprietary mapping services using closed methods, enables traceability and [verifiability](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Verifiability): 

> "At the core, "verifiability" is that everything you do can be demonstrated to be true or false by other mappers."

Transparent planning, backed by open data, plays a key role in building **public trust**. Research has shown that openness increases public acceptance of infrastructure projects ([Ciupuliga & Cuppen, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421513003601)).

Because OpenStreetMap is editable and collaborative, **local communities, NGOs, and governments** can contribute directly. This  leads to filling gaps, correcting errors, and improving the quality of infrastructure data. For example, the **YouthMappers** initiative in **Sierra Leone** enabled local students and organizations to map the power grid, helping electricity providers reduce planning costs and improve infrastructure deployment ([Charles, 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05182-1_11)).

Open grid data is also instrumental in identifying **off-grid communities** that could be connected to national networks, helping target interventions and investments ([Arderne et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0347-4)).

  <figcaption class="image-caption">Creating Foundation Electric Energy Infrastructure Data from Open-Sources document. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</div> 

OpenStreetMap's data has enabled the government and local authorities to create high-quality datasets without having to pay for expensive proprietary ones. For example, the US Department of Energy and partners have created the "Electric Energy Infrastructure Data" utilising open-source data, which led to **"estimated savings of 65% (~2 million dollars) over proprietary datasets"** ([Singh et al., 2023](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/poster-%20Creating%20Foundation%20Electric%20Energy%20Infrastructure%20Data%20from%20Open-Sources.pdf)).

### Examples from High-Income Countries
In most developed countries, publishing high-resolution, open datasets about the transmission grid has been common practice more than a decade. For example:

* [**ENTSO-E**](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/map/) provides a Europe-wide **Transmission System Map** with geo-referenced infrastructure data.
* The French grid operator **RTE** publishes its grid topology, including **5-minute resolution time-series data** on network operations ([RTE on GitHub](https://github.com/rte-france/structural-french-grid-data-with-detailed-topology-time-series)).
* Enedis, the French distribution system operator committed to Open Data since 2015, is [joining forces with OpenStreetMap France](https://www.enedis.fr/presse/open-data-enedis-participe-un-projet-collaboratif-mondial-dechange-de-donnees) to make its grid data available and encourage crowdsourcing.
* To find more open datasets about the electrical grid released by national authorities or electrical grid operators, check out our [curated a list](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/Awesome-Electric-Grid-Mapping) with more than 150 maps.

In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies publish national transmission grid data to support **emergency response, policy development, and economic planning**. These open datasets trace back to legislation from the 1990s that aimed to improve geospatial data sharing ([source](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1994-04-18/pdf/WCPD-1994-04-18-Pg779.pdf)). Within this dataset, 24% of US transmission lines state OpenStreetMap as their main source.

The [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://resilience.climate.gov/datasets/fedmaps::u-s-electric-power-transmission-lines/explore?location=38.846475%2C-76.984997%2C8.86) has shown **strong alignment** with OpenStreetMap data, demonstrating how open contributions can match official datasets in coverage and accuracy.
